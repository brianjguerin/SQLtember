# SQLtember
(surely boring) Adventures in Learning SQL

It's everybody's favorite time of the year, SQLtember!  This is my running blog of learning SQL.  I hope to update it daily during the month.  I recently completed (well, just about finished now) the Google for Data Analytics track on Coursera.  That course gave a brief introduction to SQL and exposure to Google's Big Query platform but more practice is needed to gain a good grasp.

Terms
* SQL - Structured Query Language, the language for querying databases
* Database - A container to store organized data
* DBMS - Database Management System, the software used to create and manage databases
* Table - A structured list of data of a specific type
* Schema - Information about database and table layout and properties
* Column - A single field in a table
* Datatype - A type of allowed data
* Row - A record in a table
* Primary key - A column whose value uniquely identifies every row in a table
  * No two rows can have the same primary key value
  * Every row must have a value in the primary key column (no nulls)
  * Values in primary key columns should never be modified or updated
  * Primary key values should never be reused

Notes
* Some DBMS have SQL extensions that add statements to standard SQL but all major DBMS suppor ANSI SQL
* There are many choices for a DBMS, cloud-based solutions from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM as well as traditional desktop options such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server
