(surely boring) Adventures in Learning SQL

It's everybody's favorite time of the year, SQLtember!  This is my running blog of learning SQL.  I hope to update it daily during the month.  I recently completed (well, just about finished now) the Google for Data Analytics track on Coursera.  That course gave a brief introduction to SQL and exposure to Google's Big Query platform but more practice is needed to gain a good grasp.
